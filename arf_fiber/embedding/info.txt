Embedding sensitivity studies with various configurations of outermaterials.
Base case is given in 'air' folder which gives arf fiber with only air outside
cladding.  We also have:

'glass': only glass as outer material, essentially same as claddding extending
to infinity.

'hard_hard': hard polymer coating cladding, PML located in polymer.

'hard_air': hard polyer coating, then air. PML located in air.
