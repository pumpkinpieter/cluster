This folder is for doing convergence studies on the ARF fiber with varying
outer materials.  Our default outer material has been air.  Here we try
including one or two layers of polymer and starting the PML either in those
layers or beyond them (in which case we again consider the outermost material
to be air).

Note that the fiber we use here is Poletti, which we determined to be our
default ARF fiber type.
